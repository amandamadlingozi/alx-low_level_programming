# 0x0B. C - malloc, free

## malloc : 
malloc stands for "memory allocation". The function malloc()
reserves a block of memory of specified size andreturn a pointer of type
void which can be casted into pointer ofany form.

## free
The function in C programming languege is used to dynamically de-allocate the memory. 
The memory allocated using functions malloc() and calloc() is not de-allocated on their own. 
Hence the free() method is used, whenever the dynamic memory allocation takes place. 
It helps to reduce wastage of memory by freeing it.
